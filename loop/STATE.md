# tanke — Loop State

## Phase

```
phase: build
iteration: 11
preloop_complete: yes
```

---

## Preloop Checklist

```
[x] Open project in Godot 4 editor — done
[x] source_id + atlas_coords resolved from scene files (see below)
[x] ProceduralLevel.tscn generates terrain without errors — make test clean
[x] Screencapture oracle working — make screenshot + make analyze produce valid oracle output
[x] Verify interactively: player tank moves, camera follows, no console errors (F5 in editor)
[x] Flip preloop_complete: yes above
```

## Tile Source IDs

```
tile_source_ids:
  brick:  source_id=0  atlas_coords=Vector2i(0,0)  margins=Vector2i(40,0) in sprites_1.png
  steel:  source_id=0  atlas_coords=Vector2i(0,0)  margins=Vector2i(16,0) in sprites_1.png
  grass:  source_id=0  atlas_coords=Vector2i(0,0)  margins=Vector2i(24,0) in sprites_1.png
  water:  source_id=0  atlas_coords=Vector2i(0,0)  margins=Vector2i(24,8) in sprites_1.png

## Current Scores (post iter 2)

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Headless oracle | 4 | seed + config-aware; reproducible hash |
| Algorithm variety | 4 | iter 7 cited single-field mutation: water_weight 0.6→0.2 → water -43% Δ |
| LevelConfig mutability | 5 | iter 7 full agent cycle: AGENTS.md → Edit → rerun → cite Δ |
| Level DNA | 5 | DNA-referenced config mutation + oracle confirmation in iter 7 |
| Tile visual coherence | 3 | 4/4 palettes render; all configs visually correct |
| Screencapture oracle | 4 | iter 8 --diff mode + make diff CONFIG=<preset>; per-terrain Δ + shift_detected |
| Agent edit friction | 5 | iter 7 zero-human-step cycle: AGENTS→Edit→rerun→Δ in one iter |
| Procedural richness | 4 | iter 9 biome interp: visible top-vs-bottom gradient; water +20.8% Δ |
| Pipeline completeness | 3 | gen_tile→import→TileSet→render chain verified iter 4 (brick_007) |
| GDScript correctness | 3 | make test clean; test_runner clean across configs |
| **Total** | **40/50** | +1 from iter 8; three 3-criteria remain (5/9/10); iter 10 = CONSULT |

## Oracle Reading (iter 0)

```
frame: frame00000004.png
coverage:     100.0%  score 5/5
variety:      1/4     score 1/4   ← primary target
distribution: 0.000 bits  score 0.0/5.0  ← primary target
brick: 76800px  steel: 0  grass: 0  water: 0
```

Root cause: `_pave_set()` brick condition (2≤size≤7, sid%2==0) catches nearly all
sets in elif chain before steel/grass/water checks fire. First loop task: fix.

---

## Open Seams

1. `_pave_set()` distribution algorithm — brick dominates, oracle score 0/5; needs LevelConfig weights
2. LevelConfig resource doesn't exist — blocks mutability, Level DNA
3. No stored seed in ProceduralLevel — blocks Level DNA
4. BrickBlock destruction — bullet impact TODOs in BrickBlock.gd
5. Enemy tank AI not implemented
6. World rebasing — Camera2D limit_top defaults to -10,000,000 (not infinite); infinite upward scroll will eventually hit it; needs chunk recycling / world origin rebase before approaching that bound

---

## Last Action

```
Iter 10 CONSULT: self-reflective (external agentify blocked by frozen tab from another session).
- creative-consults.md written with full H1/H2/H3 critique + Q1/Q2/Q3 answers
- KEY FINDING: iter 2 weighted refactor regressed spatial structure (lost size-based gating)
- KEY FINDING: oracle measures aggregate distribution, blind to architecture (texture vs spatial)
- KEY FINDING: Eller's slice() may emit zero-length carryovers → topological islands
- Meta-move surfaced: rubric is missing a criterion — Spatial Coherence
- 5 priority action items recorded; iter 11 selected: META + BUILD a spatial-coherence oracle
- No scores moved (CONSULT mode); total stays 40/50
```

## Stale Scores

Criterion 8 (Procedural richness) at 4/5 may be soft — biome interp is real but doesn't add intra-row spatial structure. Score holds against current rubric; iter 11 will add a separate criterion that measures what's actually missing.

---

## Next Action

`Iter 11 META+BUILD: extend RUBRIC with criterion 11 — Spatial Coherence; implement vertical-persistence metric in test_runner.gd (simplest spatial measure: per-column count of same-terrain row-adjacent pairs / total pairs). Score against default/biome/fortress/watery to anchor 1-5 levels. Honest direction trade: short-term total may drop; long-term measurement instrument matches intent.`

External CONSULT will retry iter 20 (same prompt) — agentify infrastructure should recover by then.

---

## Consult Log

None. First consult: iter 10.

## User-Look Gates

- Iter 20: playtest gate (3 seeds, report what feels monotonous)
- Iter 40: second playtest gate
