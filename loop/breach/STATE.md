# Breach loop state (arc 4)

```yaml
phase: round-24-phase-A
iter: 275
round24_blueprint: loop/breach/iter-270-round24-architect.md
round24_status: opening — Phase A (HUD-as-status) → Phase B (scaling + tier breakthroughs) → Phase C (enemy-HP recurve). Stardew delta — same BC primitives, modern HUD + progression feel. User-directed iter 270 (2026-05-24).
asset_gen_standing_capability: /agentify image_gen (ChatGPT) is the standing visual-asset pipeline — confirmed via Round 9 (4 tank archetype concept sprites) and Pro Consult 011 (motif-first procedural masks per H5). The full pipeline (prompt → image → palette extraction → 16×16 / 8×8 silhouette compliance → atlas pack) shipped end-to-end at iters 142-149. Sanctioned for HUD icons, card art, enemy variants, depot art, banner art, level decorations. Procedural PIL (`tools/gen_tile.py`, `tools/gen_archetype_sprites.py`) remains the same-iter fallback. iter 271 amendment lifts this from Round-9-specific to standing.
round25_candidate: Visual identity layer — re-skin existing systems with /agentify-generated assets where they currently use stubs/palette swaps. Likely 30-50 iters. Opens after Round 24 Phase C ships, OR earlier if user redirects. Keeps the loop substantive past Round 24 close — addresses the user's iter-271 "longer running" directive by ensuring substantive surfaces are queued (saturation = bug, not feature).
longer_running_discipline: "Longer-running loop" is NOT solved by extending cron — it's solved by ensuring the loop is always in active build. Saturation (e.g. iter-200-268 70-iter idle pattern) = bug. Cron stays at 240s active-build; queued substantive surfaces (Round 25 candidate + open-ended surface list in PROMPT.md) keep the loop bootstrapping forward.
quiet_signal_counter: 0  # iter 272, strengthened iter 273 — resets only on strong signal with SIGNAL_RECEIPT discipline (fresh source_id, used-once, action-changing). ≥3 fires adversarial-consult-over-artifact or bootstrap next round or PushNotification; ≥5 emits signal-starvation label + hard escalate.
halt_cause_label: none  # iter 272, strengthened iter 273 — signal-starvation / derivation-gap (can-halt) / stone-converged / wrong-loop (halts). Loop HALTS on: user signal + correctness violations + derivation-gap-cannot-resolve + wrong-loop. Other labels are metadata that force transition behavior.
last_strong_signal_iter: 272  # iter 273 — last iter that reset quiet_signal_counter (272 user direction: PROMPT amendment via /second-opinion synthesis; consumed iter 273 into 8-patch amendment)
feel_consult_cap: 3  # iter 273 LOWERED per /second-opinion — uncalibrated [FEEL-CONSULT] cap is 3 by default; calibrated cap 4 reachable only after CONSULT-LEDGER shows ≥2 prediction hits + hit rate ≥50% against real playtests; [FEEL] cap stays 5 (real playtest only); [IDENTITY-PROTECTED] anchors NEVER lift via [FEEL-CONSULT]; non-consultable feel criteria NEVER lift via consult (see RUBRIC.md tag legend)
consult_ledger_path: loop/breach/CONSULT-LEDGER.md  # iter 273 — every [FEEL-CONSULT] cite requires a CONSULT-LEDGER entry with falsifiable predictions + expiration + later real-playtest scoring (hit/partial/miss). Repeated misses lower future cap; repeated hits may raise to calibrated 4.
quiet_signal_source_ids_used:  # iter 273 — list of source_ids that have already reset quiet_signal_counter. A source_id may reset only once. Format: {kind, source_id, first_seen_iter, consumed_by_iter, changed_next_action, resulting_artifact}. See PROMPT.md § QUIET-SIGNAL COUNTER SIGNAL_RECEIPT format.

current_round: 24-phase-A — Stardew delta program in active build. Iters 274-275 shipped Phase A widgets 2 + 3 (reload bar, speed meter). Active-build cadence 240s (per L16). Blueprint: loop/breach/iter-270-round24-architect.md.

structural_ceiling: Rounds 5-6 lifted 30/50 → 39/65 (RUBRIC extended +C11/C12/C13 for the roguelite axes). The structural tier is now at its honest ceiling — the remaining ~26 points are [FEEL]/playtest-gated, and the remaining structural surfaces are substrate-blocked (C5) or unrequested scope (CONSULT 004).
loop_state: RUNNING — Round 24 Phase A active build. Iters 274-275 shipped widgets 2 + 3 (reload bar, speed meter). Two procedural widgets shipped in two consecutive BUILD iters — fast iteration without asset-gen detour. The non-stop loop continues building Round 24 until the user writes playtest / halt / stop.
next_action: iter 276 — Round 24 Phase A next widget. Remaining widgets all touch the shell-icon asset surface: (a) shell-chips replaces the existing shell HUD strip with a more legible row showing AP/HE/HEAT/APCR icons; needs 4 /agentify icons (or procedural fallback). (b) kill-flash briefly shows the shell icon at hit point on enemy death; depends on widget-a icons existing. (c) active-cards-ribbon needs 14 /agentify card-icon sprites. The cheapest unblock is widget (a) with PROCEDURAL fallback first (palette-aligned 8×8 colored rect chips reusing the existing _shell_color palette), then upgrade to /agentify icons later in a CAPABILITY iter. Recommended next: SHELL-CHIPS-V1 (procedural). When all 5 Phase A widgets ship → REVIEW-QUEUE entry + stranger-on-screen test + Phase B opens.

## Arc-4 amendments (user overrides — recorded iter 33)

The user has override authority over cadence and direction (PROMPT
§USER-LOOK PROTOCOL). Recorded amendments:

- **2026-05-20, playtest (iter 33):** PROMPT CONSULT constraint 2
  ("no more than three primary shell classes at first — AP/HE/HEAT")
  is **overridden**. APCR is sanctioned as the 4th shell class. Each
  shell must still keep one crisp, distinct job (constraint 3 stands):
  AP cheap/precise, HE brick-zone breacher, HEAT 2× anti-armor burst,
  APCR steel-terrain breacher + armor-piercing at 1× damage.
- **2026-05-20, playtest (iter 33):** the loop's mandate is extended
  past structural completeness — the user wants all four roguelite
  ingredients (run-to-run variety, build divergence, stakes &
  escalation, meta-progression). This is the Round 6+ program; see the
  blueprint tail in `iter-033-round5-architect.md`.
- **2026-05-20, playtest (iter 47):** APCR's steel behaviour is
  redesigned per the user — APCR PENETRATES steel (drills through,
  breaking 1 block per hit, like AP on brick; no radius cluster); the
  bullet continues until its lifetime ends. Supersedes the iter-34
  radius-breach design.
- **2026-05-21, playtest (iter 55):** the user playtested after Round
  7 and the breach-economy concept did not land as roguelite
  progression — "where is the roguelite element like level ups?" Via
  AskUserQuestion the user OVERRODE the arc-4 ANCHOR SENTENCE ("the
  tank is not becoming numerically stronger"): Round 8 adds a
  conventional roguelite power curve — XP level-ups with stat growth
  + a pick-1-of-3 upgrade card after every phase ("Both") — plus enemy
  ammo drops and longer shields. CONSULT constraint 7 ("verbs not
  passive stats") is relaxed for Round 8; constraint 1 (no choice in
  combat) is preserved. The breach economy (finite shells spent to
  breach) is KEPT as a layer, not removed. This is the Round 8
  program; blueprint iter-055-round8-architect.md.
- **2026-05-22, playtest (iter 62):** the user playtested Round 8 —
  positive verdict ("getting to an interesting spot"); the bottleneck
  is the "tank that shoots discrete bullets" primitive, too thin for
  the variety they want. Via AskUserQuestion the user redirected:
  Round 9 builds a TANK ARCHETYPE PROGRAM — 4 archetypes (Default +
  Prism + Mortar + Ram, each mechanically distinct per Into the
  Breach) + enemy HP primitive + HP bars + start-pick + event-unlock
  mid-run switching + visuals via /agentify image_gen. Two PROMPT
  overrides recorded: (a) Enemy.gd HUD writes are SANCTIONED for the
  HP-bar primitive (the Layer-2 substrate freeze relaxed for this
  HUD-only addition; hash trivially preserved); (b) /agentify
  image_gen for asset visuals is SANCTIONED, overriding the
  MLX-SD-style NO-GO (the PROMPT's intent was avoiding arc-1
  MLX-phantom-deps; /agentify is a different MCP channel under user
  control). Constraint 1 (no choice in combat) preserved; constraint
  4 (silhouette grammar) still gates generated assets. The breach
  economy + Round 8 systems STAY universal across archetypes. This
  is the Round 9 program; blueprint iter-062-round9-architect.md.

## Last action

- 2026-05-24 — **iter 100 (META + BUILD).** /code-review on
  Round 5-8 substrate (fresh scope). 3 personas dispatched
  (correctness + adversarial + invariance) in parallel against
  ~560 LoC across 6 files. After merge pipeline: **11 anchored
  findings (1 P0 + 6 P1 + 4 P2)**, full report in
  code-review-iter-100.md. **F007 codified**: F006's
  /code-review discipline should retroactively cover prior-round
  substrate; Round 5-8 sat with 11 latent findings (P0 depot
  exploit ~60 iters latent). **P0-A fixed inline** (Depot
  re-entry → `_lifetime_picked` latch; without it, picking
  HE_MAX_EXPAND_2 / FULL_RESUPPLY twice = unbounded growth /
  free resupply). New harness test_breach_depot_lifetime_pick
  with 5 assertions, all pass. Hash preserved; test-all 5/5;
  test-breach 49 → 50. Δ 0. 47/75.
- 2026-05-24 — **iter 99 (META).** Sprint retrospective for the
  iters 89-98 code-review fix work. 3 artifacts: (1) code-review-
  iter-090.md gets a status table showing 17 of 18 anchored
  findings closed (each with iter + harness reference); (2)
  CONSULT 010 written self-pre-mortem in creative-consults.md
  with 3 NEW lessons beyond F006 (regression-harness-per-fix
  discipline; paired-fix batching for small P2s; substrate-write
  counter as velocity proxy). Sharp Q3 finding: substrate-
  hardening doesn't move cognitive anchors; score 47/75 unchanged
  despite 17 fixes + 9 new harnesses; playtest 5 is the only
  signal that can shift it; (3) REVIEW-QUEUE #14 upgrade with
  the sprint-hardening note. No substrate; hash preserved;
  test-all / test-breach not re-run (META docs only). Δ 0. 47/75.
- 2026-05-24 — **iter 98 (BUILD).** P2 sweep batch 3 (final) —
  closes the code-review-iter-090 queue. P2-7 (PlayerTank.gd
  ×35): `_apply_beam_to_body` applies BEAM_DAMAGE_COOLDOWN
  uniformly to all bodies with take_damage (not just enemies);
  bricks still die in 1 tick (hp=1), but future multi-HP
  non-enemies protected from framerate melt. Updated
  test_breach_prism harness for new cooldown-gated brick
  semantics. P2-9 (MetaProgress.gd): new `archetype_ladder()`
  returning 3 rungs (PRISM@20, MORTAR@40, RAM@60) — companion
  to existing 4-rung `unlock_ladder()` (backward-compat).
  P2-5 (configs/breach_default.tres + PRESSURES.md): canonical
  answer text updated to "APCR 1-shots; HEAT 2-shots
  entrenched heavies (breach Heavy hp=3)". New harness
  test_breach_p2_batch3 with 5 assertions, all pass. Substrate
  write ×35. Hash preserved; test-all 5/5; test-breach 48 → 49.
  **CODE-REVIEW-ITER-090 QUEUE CLOSED. 17 of 18 anchored
  findings fixed across 9 iters (90-98); the 18th was below
  the 75 gate.** Δ 0. 47/75.
- 2026-05-24 — **iter 97 (BUILD).** P2 sweep batch 2 fix from
  code-review-iter-090. P2-4 (PlayerTank.gd ×34): `_die` calls
  `_stop_beam()` if PRISM, hiding the beam on the death overlay.
  P2-6 (Depot.gd): `_upgrade_pool` takes optional
  `current_archetype` param; filters same-archetype SWITCH_TO_*
  entries. `_build_choice_panel` passes `_player.archetype` with
  is_instance_valid guard. P2-2 (test_breach_meta.gd): 4-way enum
  pin assertion (MetaProgress._ARCHETYPE_* == TankArchetype.X)
  catches enum reorder. New harness test_breach_p2_batch2 with
  4 assertions; meta enum-pin verified. Substrate write ×34.
  Hash preserved; test-all 5/5; test-breach 47 → 48.
  **14 of 18 anchored code-review findings closed.** Δ 0. 47/75.
- 2026-05-24 — **iter 96 (BUILD).** P2 sweep batch 1 fix from
  code-review-iter-090. P2-1 (RunRecapAnalyzer): verdict
  "insufficient_data" for sigs.size() < 2 instead of misleading
  "similar". P2-3 (PlayerTank.gd ×33): _init_archetype MORTAR
  stops GunTimer + sets can_shoot=true before wait_time
  (mirrors iter-88 _revert_archetype hygiene). P2-8
  (MortarShell.gd): _physics_process clamps t with minf(1.0, ...)
  before lerp (prevents frame-spike overshoot). New harness
  test_breach_p2_batch1 with 5 assertions, all pass. Substrate
  write ×33. Hash preserved; test-all 5/5; test-breach 46 → 47.
  **11 of 18 anchored code-review findings closed.** Δ 0. 47/75.
- 2026-05-24 — **iter 95 (BUILD).** P1-4 fix from code-review-
  iter-090: RunRecap.archetype contract. Three coordinated
  PlayerTank.gd changes (×32): _ready captures run-start
  archetype after run_recap creation; _on_breach_band_changed
  no longer overwrites archetype on band changes (REMOVED that
  line); _pick_archetype updates archetype to the picked value
  so pick-screen choice IS the run-start (overrides _ready
  DEFAULT capture). New harness test_breach_run_recap_archetype_
  contract with 6 assertions (fresh _ready DEFAULT, switch_archetype
  doesn't overwrite, band crossing doesn't overwrite, multi-event
  preserved, _pick_archetype overrides, post-pick switch
  preserved). Substrate write ×32. Hash preserved; test-all 5/5;
  test-breach 45 → 46. Δ 0. 47/75. **ALL 6 P1s + 2 P0s now
  closed (7 of 8 anchored findings).**
- 2026-05-24 — **iter 94 (BUILD).** P1-2 + P1-6 paired fix from
  code-review-iter-090. P1-2 (PlayerTank.gd ×31): `_pick_archetype`
  now routes through `switch_archetype`, ensuring `_revert_archetype`
  runs first if current archetype is non-DEFAULT. Latent today but
  defensive against future callers. P1-6 (MortarShell.gd, arc-4-
  owned): `_explode` + `_spawn_burst` add
  `is_instance_valid(parent_node) and not
  parent_node.is_queued_for_deletion()` guards before iterating
  children / add_child — prevents crash on scene-reload mid-shell-
  flight. New harness test_breach_pick_archetype_and_mortar_guard
  with 4 assertions (RAM start speed=38; _pick_archetype(DEFAULT)
  from RAM reverts speed to 32; MortarShell._explode against
  queued-for-deletion parent no-ops; no ColorRect burst added to
  queued parent). Substrate write ×31. Hash preserved; test-all
  5/5; test-breach 44 → 45. Δ 0. 47/75.
- 2026-05-24 — **iter 93 (BUILD).** P1-3 + P1-5 paired fix from
  code-review-iter-090. P1-3 (PlayerTank.gd ×30): switch_archetype
  validates value in [DEFAULT, RAM] range; out-of-range pushes
  warning + returns. P1-5 (Depot.gd, arc-4-owned): all 3
  SWITCH_TO_* apply_upgrade branches add `is_instance_valid(_player)`
  guard alongside the existing `!= null` + `has_method` checks.
  New harness test_breach_switch_archetype_validation with 8
  assertions (out-of-range / same-value / boundary / valid /
  null _player / freed _player). Substrate write ×30. Hash
  preserved; test-all 5/5; test-breach 43 → 44. Δ 0. 47/75.
- 2026-05-24 — **iter 92 (BUILD).** P0-2 fix from code-review-
  iter-090: FASTER_RELOAD XP bonus survives archetype switches.
  New cumulative-reduction model: `_base_default_gun_wait_time`
  (captured _ready) + `_reload_reduction` (accumulated). Per-
  archetype wait_time = max(RELOAD_MIN, arch_base − reduction).
  Modified `_apply_level_boost` FASTER_RELOAD branch,
  `_init_archetype` MORTAR branch, `_revert_archetype` MORTAR
  branch. New harness test_breach_xp_reload_persistence with 8
  assertions (DEFAULT fresh, 1 boost, DEFAULT→MORTAR carry,
  MORTAR→RAM→MORTAR round-trip, 2nd boost composes, floor).
  Empirical: 1.00 → 0.90 → 1.40 → 0.90 → 1.40 → 1.30 → 0.35.
  Substrate write ×29. Hash preserved; test-all 5/5; test-breach
  42 → 43. Δ 0. 47/75.
- 2026-05-23 — **iter 91 (BUILD).** P0-1 fix from code-review-
  iter-090: archetype-select now pauses the world. Three changes
  in PlayerTank.gd (substrate write ×28): `_show_archetype_select`
  sets `get_tree().paused = true` + `process_mode = PROCESS_MODE_
  ALWAYS` on self; new `_exit_archetype_select` helper centralizes
  cleanup; `_pick_archetype` routes through it; `_physics_process`
  dead-during-selector branch escapes cleanly. New regression
  harness test_breach_archetype_select_pause.gd verifies 6
  assertions (tree paused, player process_mode ALWAYS, stub Node
  ticks=0 while paused, _pick_archetype unpause + restore, stub
  resumes, dead-during-selector escape). All pass. Hash preserved;
  test-all 5/5; test-breach 41 → 42. Δ 0. 47/75.
- 2026-05-23 — **iter 90 (META + BUILD).** Resumed loop per user
  feedback ("u havent done enough to deserve a pause"). Invoked
  /code-review on Round 9-10-11 substrate: 5 personas + codex
  cross-model in parallel returned 18 anchor-≥75 findings (2 P0,
  6 P1, 10 P2). Full report in code-review-iter-090.md. F006
  codified: iter-87 single-pass self-audit missed all 18.
  **Discipline update: /code-review at every round close, not
  self-audit.** Fixed P1-1 inline (Enemy.take_damage idempotency
  guard, 1 line). New regression harness test_breach_double_kill
  (41 in test-breach). Fix queue for iters 091-096+ enumerated.
  Substrate write Enemy.gd ×2. Hash preserved; test-all 5/5;
  test-breach 40 → 41. Δ 0. 47/75.
- 2026-05-23 — **iter 89 (META).** Clean loop pause per loop-skill
  step 6 + iter-54/61/72 reconciliation. Meta-trigger: user keeps
  invoking /loop; loop keeps manufacturing work; both are weak
  proxies for actual intent. Honest move = put direction-choice
  back in user's hands. All pre-playtest deliverables shipped;
  remaining Round-11 candidates gated on playtest evidence. No
  ScheduleWakeup. Resume signals listed in next_action. No
  substrate; hash preserved. Δ 0. 47/75.
- 2026-05-23 — **iter 88 (BUILD-QUALITY).** Resolved S1/S2/S3
  cleanup observations from iter-87 audit. Extended
  `_revert_archetype` to clear `_ram_swing_timer` (S1),
  `_beam_dmg_timer` (S2), and stop GunTimer + reset can_shoot (S3)
  on switch. Side effect: SWITCH cancels MORTAR reload (instant
  fire on switched archetype) — consistent with the iter-69
  "switching like a weapon" direction; flag for playtest feedback.
  Extended test_breach_archetype_switch with S1/S2/S3 assertions
  — all pass. Substrate write ×27. Hash preserved; test-all 5/5;
  test-breach 40/40. Δ 0 ([QUALITY] tag). 47/75.
- 2026-05-23 — **iter 87 (SWEEP).** Round 9-10-11 substrate
  audit. Read-only audit of per-archetype state machine
  (PlayerTank.gd 491-605). 3 cleanup-tier state-hygiene
  observations: S1 `_ram_swing_timer` not reverted; S2
  `_beam_dmg_timer` not reverted; S3 GunTimer running with stale
  wait_time after MORTAR→other switch (one-shot timing anomaly;
  self-corrects). All harmless — state-leaks with no observable
  effect. No correctness bugs found. Substrate is
  playtest-5-ready. Hash preserved. Δ 0. 47/75.
- 2026-05-23 — **iter 86 (META).** Round 11 candidate (c)
  armor-asymmetry resolution — design doc shipped
  (iter-086-armor-asymmetry-design.md). Names both readings —
  (a) universal armor (add per-archetype armor-piercing depot
  upgrades) vs (b) armor-bypass-as-verb (current, asymmetry as
  design intent). Key finding: armor question is DOWNSTREAM of
  REVIEW-QUEUE #15 identities-vs-weapons (a≈weapons,
  b≈identities). Recommendation: pause until #15 settles via
  playtest 5. Both implementation paths sketched (~3-5 iters
  each). No code; no hash impact; doc-only iter. Δ 0. 47/75.
- 2026-05-23 — **iter 85 (SPIKE).** Round 11 Phase 2: SWARM
  α/β/γ comparison — **F005 falsified the iter-84 blueprint**.
  All 3 variants VIOLATE the cross-archetype hierarchy rule under
  the iter-77-style single-event probe (α/β: 3 archetypes tie
  COSTLY; γ: 4-way tie BAD). Root cause: probe measures kills-
  per-event (one fire burst) — captures MORTAR's one-shell-AoE
  pattern but undercounts PRISM continuous-DPS, RAM multi-swing,
  DEFAULT discrete-over-cooldowns. Iter-77 stub-probe pattern
  doesn't extend to sustained-DPS hierarchy verification.
  Codified F005 in FALSIFICATIONS.md. SWARM commit DEFERRED
  until playtest 5 data feeds the iter-83 analyzer. Loop has
  built everything it can pre-playtest; iter 86 = idle heartbeat
  awaiting playtest. test-all 5/5; test-breach 39 → 40. Δ 0.
  47/75.
- 2026-05-23 — **iter 84 (META).** Round 11 Phase 2 SPIKE
  architect blueprint. Wrote iter-084-round11-phase2-spike.md
  naming 3 SWARM variants: α swarmlet (4-5 Light chevron pack —
  predicted 3 distinct outcomes; favored), β Fast-rusher pack
  (DEFAULT=PRISM both bad — violates hierarchy rule; reject), γ
  Heavy-pair "spinet" (different pressure — Round 12 candidate).
  iter 85 SPIKE harness compares variants. Loop-discipline note:
  Phase 2 is CONTENT (speculative per Pro's H5); iter 84 META
  only, iter 85 SPIKE only if engagement continues. No substrate;
  hash preserved. Δ 0. 47/75.
- 2026-05-23 — **iter 83 (BUILD).** Round 11 Phase 1 continuation:
  band-shape analyzer + death-screen surface. New
  scripts/RunRecapAnalyzer.gd (arc-4-owned) with static
  compare_signatures returning pairwise sequence-distance +
  time-distance + verdict ("similar" / "distinct" per threshold).
  PlayerTank._die updated to append "bands visited: ..." to the
  _breach_prompt_label text — substrate write ×26 inside the
  existing breach-mode gate. Resized the prompt panel/label to
  fit. Harness verifies 4 micro-cases + 4-archetype mock
  (DEFAULT↔PRISM=0 same seq; DEFAULT↔MORTAR=1 tail mismatch;
  DEFAULT↔RAM=2 reorder; verdict "similar" when any pair=0).
  Hash preserved; test-all 5/5; test-breach 38 → 39. Phase 1
  COMPLETE. Δ 0. 47/75.
- 2026-05-23 — **iter 82 (BUILD).** Round 11 Phase 1 start:
  band-shape recorder. Collapsed iter-81's heartbeat-#2 into the
  BUILD path — user actively prompting. RunRecap.gd extended
  with `archetype` + `band_visit_log` fields + `enter_band()` +
  `band_signature()` + extended `format()`; PlayerTank.gd
  `_on_breach_band_changed` wired to call `run_recap.enter_band`
  (inside existing run_recap-null guard; no new gating). Harness
  verifies idempotency, order preservation, signature schema, and
  format() integration (8 in-harness checks). Substrate write ×25
  on PlayerTank.gd. Hash preserved; test-all 5/5; test-breach
  37 → 38. Δ 0. 47/75.
- 2026-05-23 — **iter 81 (META).** Idle heartbeat #1. No
  playtest signal at the 1800s wakeup. Extending cadence to
  3600s for iter 82 per the iter-54/61/72 reconciliation
  pattern. No work this iter — pure log + reschedule. Δ 0. 47/75.
- 2026-05-23 — **iter 80 (META).** Round 11 diagnose. Named 5
  candidates: (a) **band-shape recorder** (NEW DEFAULT —
  addresses CONSULT 009 blind spot; 3-5 iters), (b) enemy roster
  expansion (4 PRESSURES gaps), (c) armor-asymmetry resolution
  (design call), (d) identity-vs-weapons clarification (REVIEW-
  QUEUE #15 settles via playtest), (e) defer to playtest 5 (this
  iter's choice). Recommendation: (e). Loop enters idle heartbeat
  1800s. The iter-072 diagnose's "enemy roster" default is
  SUPERSEDED by (a) — CONSULT 009's correction. iter-080-round11-
  diagnose.md is the readable artifact. No substrate; hash
  preserved. Δ 0. 47/75.
- 2026-05-23 — **iter 79 (META).** Round 10-close. Three artifacts:
  (1) CONSULT 009 — written self-pre-mortem; key reframe is that
  Round 10's instrumentation is single-moment-strong but
  multi-band-blind — every artifact tests one moment, not a
  run-shape across 5 bands. The PLAYTEST-5-BRIEF mitigates
  cognitively; no harness measures run-shape distinctness yet.
  (2) REVIEW-QUEUE #14 upgrade — re-headed the ★ PLAYTEST REQUEST
  with pointers to PLAYTEST-5-BRIEF, the on-death overlay, and
  the open #15 / armor-asymmetry / band-shape-blind-spot
  questions. (3) RUBRIC reflection — no new criterion; C5 lift
  scored at iter 76. Round 10 carried 1 rubric anchor (46/75 →
  47/75). No substrate; hash preserved. Δ 0 at close. 47/75.
- 2026-05-23 — **iter 78 (BUILD).** Round 10 Phase 3: playtest
  instrumentation. Two artifacts: (1) on-death structured prompt
  — new `_breach_prompt_panel`/`_breach_prompt_label` in
  PlayerTank.gd, gated on `loadout != null`, shown in `_die()`
  flow; text: "which moment did you regret? right archetype?
  would switching help?" — the three questions focus on the open
  C15 anchor 5 / identity-vs-weapons axis. (2) PLAYTEST-5-BRIEF.md
  — one-page brief covering the four characteristic-mistake
  temptations (PRISM overcommit / MORTAR lazy safety / RAM
  reckless pathing / Default shell waste), 5-run playtest spec,
  6 specific things to learn. Substrate write #24 on PlayerTank.gd;
  hash preserved; test-all 5/5; test-breach 37/37. Phase 3 COMPLETE
  — iter 79 = Round-10 close. Δ 0. 47/75.
- 2026-05-23 — **iter 77 (BUILD).** Round 10 Phase 2 continuation:
  pressure-probe harness. 5 focused probes vs an armored Heavy
  stub confirmed the PRESSURES.md armor-bypass asymmetry:
  DEFAULT+AP=0 (BLOCKED), DEFAULT+HEAT=2 (bypass+×2), PRISM=1,
  MORTAR AoE=2, RAM swing=2. Empirically validates the iter-73
  spine "every archetype must buy passage differently" — DEFAULT
  pays in shell economy; the other three pay in
  exposure/positioning/HP. No substrate; hash preserved; test-all
  5/5; test-breach 36 → 37. Phase 2 COMPLETE; iter 78 = Phase 3
  instrumentation. Δ 0. 47/75.
- 2026-05-23 — **iter 76 (BUILD).** Round 10 Phase 2: PRESSURES.md
  per-archetype × per-pressure matrix shipped. 10 pressure rows ×
  4 archetypes; every pressure has ≥1 best answer; 4 ROSTER GAPS
  identified for Round 11 (DENSE SWARM has no spawn cluster;
  LONG-LOS lacks a sniper to punish PRISM exposure; HEAVY ARMOR
  beyond 3hp Heavy is undertested; TRUE SUPPRESSION undertested).
  Matrix surfaced a real design question: armor logic lives ONLY
  in Bullet.gd — PRISM/MORTAR/RAM call take_damage
  unconditionally. Two readings (universal armor vs per-archetype
  bypass-as-verb) — captured for Round 11 user direction.
  C5 lifts 2→3 (anchor 2 "documented canonical answer"). No
  substrate; hash preserved. test-all/test-breach not re-run
  (doc-only). Δ +1. 47/75.
- 2026-05-23 — **iter 75 (BUILD).** Round 10 Phase 1 continuation:
  added 4 play-relevant derived axes (damage_rate_hz / magnitude /
  persistence / range_shape) to the distinctness audit. 10-axis
  vector; threshold ≥5 of 10. ALL 6 pairs now 9-10/10 distinct
  (min 9, max 10) — play-relevant axes are MORE distinct than
  structural axes; residual tie is `move_blocked: no` for the
  three non-PRISM archetypes. CALIBRATION WARNING fires as
  designed: min ratio 0.90 > 0.80 ceiling — audit too easy,
  Phase 2 must add tighter signals. No substrate; hash preserved;
  test-all 5/5; test-breach 36/36. Δ 0. 46/75.
- 2026-05-23 — **iter 74 (BUILD).** Round 10 Phase 1: distinctness-
  audit harness scaffold. Per Consult 008's H4 reframe, built
  loop/breach/test_breach_distinctness_audit.gd — compares per-
  archetype 6-axis STRUCTURAL signal vectors (weapon_kind /
  move_blocked / range_class / cadence_class / damage_source / live
  fingerprint); asserts pairwise distance ≥3 of 6. Min pairwise
  5/6 — DEFAULT↔PRISM and PRISM↔MORTAR and PRISM↔RAM all 6/6
  (PRISM is the most distinct); DEFAULT/MORTAR/RAM share only the
  `move_blocked: no` signal. Honest baseline; 2-buffer above
  threshold. Phase-1 continuation iter 75 adds play-sim signals
  (kill distance / time stationary / wall interaction). No
  substrate; hash anchor preserved. test-all 5/5; test-breach
  35 → 36. Δ 0 (C5 lifts at Phase 2 close). 46/75.
- 2026-05-23 — **iter 73 (META).** Consult 008 captured + Round 10
  rethesis. User-initiated /second-opinion fired iter 72; GPT Pro
  extended thinking (~6 min) returned a sharp reframe: **"Round 9
  solved INPUT POVERTY, not yet DECISION POVERTY"** — different
  verbs ≠ different games. The iter-072 "enemy roster expansion"
  default became rubric-chasing per Pro; the stronger Round-10
  thesis is **archetype pressure design + distinctness
  instrumentation**. Three-phase rethesis written
  (iter-073-round10-rethesis.md): Phase 1 distinctness-audit harness
  (iters 74-75); Phase 2 PRESSURES.md matrix (76-77); Phase 3
  curated playtest instrumentation (78); close iter 79.
  REVIEW-QUEUE #15 (identities-vs-weapons design question) +
  #16 (pressure matrix + distinctness audit) opened. Loop exits
  idle-heartbeat — Phase 1 build is non-speculative. No substrate;
  hash anchor preserved. Δ 0 (the pressure matrix will plausibly
  lift C5 anchor 2 at Phase 2 close). 46/75.
- 2026-05-23 — **iter 72 (META).** Round 10 diagnose. Named 3
  candidates: (a) enemy roster expansion against the new archetypes
  (lifts C5 from 2 → 4; 4-7 BUILD iters); (b) arc-3 OG roster
  import (lifts C5 from 2 → 3; cheaper, 2-4 SPIKE + 3-5 BUILD); (c)
  defer to playtest verdict. Recommendation: (c) — every prior round
  (5/6/7/8/9) was direction-set by a user playtest; building speculative
  SPIKE work before #14 closes is high-variance. Written
  loop/breach/iter-072-round10-diagnose.md (L2 compaction-safe).
  Loop enters idle heartbeat at 1800s per iter-54/61 reconciliation.
  No substrate; hash anchor preserved. Δ 0. 46/75.
- 2026-05-23 — **iter 71 (META).** Round 9-close. Three artifacts:
  (1) CONSULT 007 — written self-pre-mortem on the 3 permanent
  questions + Round-9 distinctness + rubric, captured to
  creative-consults.md. Key reframe: Round 9 re-establishes CONSULT
  constraint 7 (verbs+affordances) maximally; the structural ceiling
  is reached, the cognitive ceiling is playtest-gated. (2) REVIEW-
  QUEUE #14 — ★ PLAYTEST REQUEST — Round 9 complete; summarizes all
  8 sub-rounds + the open #13 integration-path decision. (3) RUBRIC
  +C15 "Tank archetypes" — 15 criteria, 75-pt absolute ceiling; C15
  lands at 4 (structural ceiling), anchor 5 identity-protected.
  Score 42/70 → 46/75. No substrate; hash anchor preserved; test-all
  5/5; test-breach 35/35.
- 2026-05-23 — **iter 70 (BUILD).** Round 9h — visual assets via
  /agentify image_gen. 3 parallel ChatGPT image_gen calls returned 3
  concept sprites (~300×300) saved to
  img/archetype_{prism,mortar,ram}_concept.png. CONSULT constraint 4
  silhouette gate PASSES at concept tier: cyan beam-aperture / olive
  angled-barrel / red plow — each archetype's verb is readable from
  silhouette alone. REVIEW-QUEUE #13 opened with 3 integration paths;
  default if no answer = algorithmic tint+overlay via extended
  gen_tile.py. No substrate touched; hash anchor preserved.
  Δ 0 (C15 at round close). 42/70.
- 2026-05-23 — **iter 69 (BUILD).** Round 9g — event-unlock mid-run
  archetype switching: new Depot.UpgradeKind SWITCH_TO_PRISM/MORTAR/RAM
  (gated by MetaProgress tiers @20/40/60); apply_upgrade calls the
  player's new `switch_archetype` (reverts current archetype mods via
  `_revert_archetype` then re-inits, so speed/GunTimer/beam-line stay
  clean across multiple switches); `_build_beam_line` made
  idempotent. test_breach_meta + test_breach_overdrive updated for
  the wider catalog. Hash anchor preserved (only PlayerTank substrate
  write, gated); test-all 5/5, test-breach 35/35 (new
  check-breach-archetype-switch). Δ 0 (C15 at round close). 42/70.

## Next action

**Iter 101 — BUILD — code-review-iter-100 fix sprint batch 1.**

Read `loop/breach/code-review-iter-100.md` "P1-A" and "P1-B"
sections.

Paired fixes:
- **P1-A** (Bullet.gd `_on_body_entered` APCR branch): change
  `if _steel_drilled == STEEL_SALVAGE_THRESHOLD` to `if
  _steel_drilled >= THRESHOLD and not _salvage_paid: _salvage_paid =
  true; _try_steel_salvage()`. Add `var _salvage_paid: bool = false`.
  Also move `_steel_drilled` increment INSIDE the
  `body.has_method("breach")` guard so inert steel doesn't tick.
- **P1-B** (PlayerTank.gd `_physics_process` codex dismiss):
  after `_dismiss_codex()` call, add `return` so the same frame
  doesn't continue to `_fire()` input processing.

Regression harness `loop/breach/test_breach_steel_salvage_threshold.gd`
verifies P1-A (≥-threshold + latch behavior); extend test_breach_codex
OR add a new check for P1-B (verify `_fire` not invoked on dismiss
frame).

Substrate write #36 on PlayerTank.gd (P1-B). Bullet.gd is arc-4
extended (substrate, sanctioned). Hash-anchor verify; test-all +
test-breach green.
