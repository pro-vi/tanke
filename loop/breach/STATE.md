loop_state: RUNNING (resumed iter 33). User playtested 2026-05-20; the loop integrated the verdict, logged F003, opened Round 5. The non-stop loop continues per PROMPT until the user writes `playtest` / `halt` / `stop`.
next_action: iter 44 — BUILD — loadout-lifecycle fix. Read iter-043-round6e-architect.md Finding 1. Confirm with a probe harness that breach run 2+ currently starts with run 1's depleted reserves (the shared breach_starter_loadout.tres is mutated by consume() + survives reload_current_scene); fix it — PlayerTank `_ready` duplicates the loadout into a private per-run copy; update the ~3 harnesses (test_breach_loadout / hud / swap) that assume pt.loadout identity. Then iter 45 = meta-progression Option A (depot-pool widening) + RUBRIC C13; iter 46 = Round 6 close.

## Arc-4 amendments (user overrides — recorded iter 33)

The user has override authority over cadence and direction (PROMPT
§USER-LOOK PROTOCOL). Recorded amendments:

- **2026-05-20, playtest (iter 33):** PROMPT CONSULT constraint 2
  ("no more than three primary shell classes at first — AP/HE/HEAT")
  is **overridden**. APCR is sanctioned as the 4th shell class. Each
  shell must still keep one crisp, distinct job (constraint 3 stands):
  AP cheap/precise, HE brick-zone breacher, HEAT 2× anti-armor burst,
  APCR steel-terrain breacher + armor-piercing at 1× damage.
- **2026-05-20, playtest (iter 33):** the loop's mandate is extended
  past structural completeness — the user wants all four roguelite
  ingredients (run-to-run variety, build divergence, stakes &
  escalation, meta-progression). This is the Round 6+ program; see the
  blueprint tail in `iter-033-round5-architect.md`.

## Preloop checklist

Loop halts if any unchecked when iter > 0:

- [x] Read `loop/META-RETRO.md` (arc 1 close) — 50/55, 1.78 pts/iter, engine substrate
- [x] Read `loop/gameplay/META-RETRO-iter100.md` (arc 2 close) — 34/50, identity-not-mechanics lesson
- [x] Read `loop/originals/iter027-meta-arc3-ceiling.md` (arc 3 close) — 51/60, structural ceiling
- [x] Read `loop/session-learnings-2026-05-18.md` (L1 SPIKE / L2 blueprint / L3 BUILD-QUALITY / L4 ceiling-paused / L5 default-on gating / L6 AUDIT trigger taxonomy; R1 bundled-anchor / R2 IDENTITY-PROTECTED / R3 three-tier ceiling / R4 quality-iter signal)
- [x] Read `.research/synthesis-arc4-creative-consult-2026-05-19.md` — "breach economy" stone, 7 constraints, sentence test
- [x] Verify `make test` exits 0
- [x] Verify procedural mode loads + `playable: true` (reachable=676 cells, seed 42)
- [x] Verify OG mode: `check-loader` PASS + `check-chain` reports `CHAIN_25_OK`
- [x] Verify hash anchor `23d6a2ec3bf2821f…` on procedural baseline (seed 42, default config)
- [x] `preloop_complete: yes` flipped

## Arc-4 stone (from CONSULT §9)

> Battle City as a vertical breach roguelite: a single-life tank climbs
> through fortified depth bands by managing shells, terrain destruction,
> and depot-based upgrades.

## Identity anchor

**Breach economy.** *What are you willing to spend to open the next vertical lane?*

## Sentence test (every upgrade must pass)

*"This upgrade helps me climb through ___ by changing how I use ___."*

## Last action

- 2026-05-20 — **iter 43 (SPIKE).** Round 6e (meta-progression) opened
  with a SPIKE. Verdict: meta = depot-pool widening (best_depth unlocks
  upgrade kinds — options-not-power, low-risk). Surfaced a correctness
  finding: the breach loadout is a SHARED Resource → run 2+ likely
  starts with run 1's depleted reserves. Blueprint:
  iter-043-round6e-architect.md. 36/60.

## Next action

**Iter 44 — BUILD — loadout-lifecycle fix.**
Read `loop/breach/iter-043-round6e-architect.md` (Finding 1). Confirm
the bug with a probe harness (run-2-starts-fresh), then fix it —
PlayerTank `_ready` duplicates the loadout into a private per-run copy;
update the ~3 harnesses (test_breach_loadout / hud / swap) that assume
pt.loadout identity. Hash-anchor verify; test-all + test-breach green.
Then iter 45 = meta-progression Option A + RUBRIC C13; iter 46 = the
Round 6 CONSULT + QUEUE close.

The loop runs non-stop until the user writes `playtest` / `halt` /
`stop`, or a correctness violation fires (hash anchor break, test-all
regression, unsanctioned substrate write, unfixed band reachability).
