Append-only. One block per iteration. Iter 0 is bootstrap (no scoring).

## Iter 000 — BOOTSTRAP

**Mode:** BOOTSTRAP (no scoring)
**Date:** 2026-05-10
**Branch:** `exp/godot4-loop`

### Preloop resolution

User F5 confirmed tank renders + moves with WASD/arrows on the gameplay scene.

One blocker surfaced + fixed during preloop:
- `project.godot:14 run/main_scene` was `res://scenes/Level.tscn` (the legacy
  hand-built scene). Its `Level.gd` references nonexistent child nodes
  `$Tiles/Brick` / `$Tiles/Steel` / `$Tiles/Grass` / `$Tiles/Water` (actual
  nodes are `BrickTileMap` etc.), so F5 launched a broken scene with red
  spam in Output. Switched to `res://scenes/ProceduralLevel.tscn` so F5
  lands on the gameplay-target scene (the one with the iter-29 shoot-signal
  fix and `playable.tres` default). `project.godot` is not in the substrate
  freeze list — this is a config flip, not a generation-logic change.

### Substrate baseline

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Active scene | `scenes/ProceduralLevel.tscn` |
| Active config | `configs/playable.tres` |
| Seed | 42 (oracle reference) |
| `playable` | **true** |
| `reachable_cells` | 804 |
| `rows_climbed` | 29 |
| `min_reachable_row` | 0 |
| `cc_count` / `cc_avg` / `cc_max` | 49 / 12.08 / 60 |
| `eller_sets` / `eller_avg_size` / `eller_max_size` | 15 / 1.33 / 3 |
| `vert_structure_lift` | 2.63 |
| `tile_hash` (seed 42) | `f873ae60ee3c420c57cdef5762acdad857b1a763ec50b76db80971ef4503e797` |
| Headless boot | `godot --quit` exit 0, no errors |

### Substrate internalized (from META-RETRO "What survives past the loop")

Engine-loop deliverables I will not modify and may reuse:
1. `LevelDNA` + `BiomeConfig` + named presets (serializable level-recipe system)
2. Hash-anchor pattern (16-char fingerprint, one-shot regression check)
3. `structure_lift` metric (IID-normalized vertical-pair correlation)
4. `gen_tile.py --from-sheet` (palette-aware tile generation)
5. Eller's invariant fix (≥1 carry per set)
6. Cited mutation cycles (edit → rerun → cite Δ)
7. `AGENTS.md` parameter map

### Scores

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| 1. Core loop closes | 0 | Shooting broken (Bullet.tscn missing script) |
| 2. Spawn / wave system | 0 | No enemies |
| 3. HP + death model | 0 | No HP |
| 4. XP + level-up flow | 0 | No XP |
| 5. Upgrade variety | 0 | No upgrades |
| 6. Enemy variety | 0 | No enemies |
| 7. Run pacing | 0 | No run structure |
| 8. Visual feedback / juice | 0 | None |
| 9. UI / UX | 0 | No HUD |
| 10. Build distinctness | 0 | No builds |
| **Total** | **0/50** | Floor; gameplay loop starts here |

### Files touched

- `project.godot` (`run/main_scene` Level.tscn → ProceduralLevel.tscn)
- `loop/gameplay/STATE.md` (preloop_complete → yes, baseline recorded, next action set)
- `loop/gameplay/LEDGER.md` (this file, created)

### Schedule

- Iter 1 = BUILD (fix Bullet system per open seam #1, advance criterion 1)
- ScheduleWakeup cadence: 240s for BUILD per PROMPT §7
- First mandatory PLAYTEST: iter 5 (or earlier if shoot+move+enemies all work)

---

## Iter 001 — BUILD — Bullet system

**Mode:** BUILD
**Focus:** criterion 1 (core loop closes) — fix the broken Bullet so shoot+travel+collision actually works
**Date:** 2026-05-10
**Pre-mortem:** PRE-MORTEMS.md iter 001 (predicted criterion 1 → 2/5; predicted headless clean; predicted oracle unchanged)

### Diagnose

Weakest axis: **criterion 1 (Core loop closes) at 0/5**. Evidence: STATE.md
iter-0 scores all at floor; user F5 confirms move works (iter 0), but
shooting known broken per open seam #1. PROMPT §"KNOWN BROKEN" iter-1 work:
fix the Bullet system.

### Findings during inspection

PROMPT was slightly off: `Bullet.gd` *did* exist (at repo root, not in
`scripts/`). The actual blockers were:
1. `scenes/Bullet.tscn` was `format=2` (Godot 3) — broken ext_resource
   syntax + `extents` on RectangleShape2D (Godot 4 wants `size`)
2. Only `area_entered` was wired — but terrain (BrickBlock, WaterBlock,
   TileMapLayer) is `StaticBody2D`, so collisions never fired
3. `speed = 5` in the .tscn (Godot-3 frame-tied speed) is unplayable at
   `_process(delta)` semantics — 5 px/sec × 1s lifetime = 5px total travel
4. `Bullet.gd` at repo root violates the `scripts/` convention used by
   every other game script

### Actions

1. Moved `Bullet.gd` repo-root → `scripts/Bullet.gd` (preserved
   `uid://cbdxbbvo1fdgj` in `scripts/Bullet.gd.uid`; deleted root files)
2. Rewrote `scripts/Bullet.gd` typed (consistent with iter-27 substrate):
   - `start(pos: Vector2, dir: int)` sets position/rotation/velocity, sets
     timer `wait_time = lifetime` and starts it
   - `_physics_process(delta)` moves the bullet (physics frame so collision
     callbacks sync)
   - `_on_area_entered(_area)` + `_on_body_entered(_body)` both
     `queue_free()` — covers future enemies (Areas) and current terrain
     (StaticBodies)
   - `_on_lifetime_timeout()` `queue_free()`
   - Defaults: `speed = 120` px/s, `damage = 1`, `lifetime = 2.0s`
3. Migrated `scenes/Bullet.tscn`:
   - `format=2` → `format=3` with proper Godot 4 ext_resource syntax
   - `extents = Vector2(2.00204, 1.50773)` → `size = Vector2(4, 3)` (Godot
     4 RectangleShape2D uses full size, not half-extents — `2.00204*2 ≈ 4`)
   - Removed the `speed = 5` override (let Bullet.gd default of 120 stand)
   - `collision_layer = 4` (Bullet), `collision_mask = 1` (Environment)
   - `LifeTimeTimer wait_time = 2.0, one_shot = true`
   - Signal connections updated to `_on_area_entered`, `_on_body_entered`,
     `_on_lifetime_timeout`

### Verification

- `godot --headless --path . --quit` → exit 0, clean (one cosmetic UID-cache
  warning about `uid://cbdxbbvo1fdgj` falling back to text path — Godot
  will refresh the UID cache on next editor open; harmless)
- Reachability oracle (seed 42): `playable: true, reachable_cells: 804,
  rows_climbed: 29, tile_hash: f873ae60ee3c420c…` — identical to iter-0
  baseline. Bullet changes don't touch tile placement, as predicted.

### Scores

| Criterion | Iter 0 | Iter 1 | Δ | Citation |
|-----------|--------|--------|---|----------|
| 1. Core loop closes | 0 | **2** | +2 | `scripts/Bullet.gd:13-30`, `scenes/Bullet.tscn:9-26`, headless boot exit 0. Capped at 2 — feel criterion, needs playtest for >2. |
| 2. Spawn / wave system | 0 | 0 | – | No enemies still |
| 3. HP + death model | 0 | 0 | – | No HP still |
| 4. XP + level-up flow | 0 | 0 | – | – |
| 5. Upgrade variety | 0 | 0 | – | – |

| 7. Run pacing | 0 | 0 | – | – |
| 8. Visual feedback / juice | 0 | 0 | – | No spark/impact yet |
| 9. UI / UX | 0 | 0 | – | – |
| 10. Build distinctness | 0 | 0 | – | – |
| **Total** | **0** | **2** | **+2** | |

### Pre-mortem evaluation

Prediction 1 (criterion 1 → 2): **landed** as called.
Prediction 2 (headless clean): **landed** (one cosmetic UID warning aside).
Prediction 3 (oracle unchanged): **landed** exactly.

No falsifications this iter — pre-mortem was conservative and correct.
Real falsification risk shifts to iter 5 playtest: does the bullet actually
visibly move and visibly despawn? Code says yes; user eyes will tell.

### Files touched

- Created: `scripts/Bullet.gd`, `scripts/Bullet.gd.uid`,
  `loop/gameplay/PRE-MORTEMS.md`
- Rewrote: `scenes/Bullet.tscn` (format 2 → 3 migration)
- Deleted: `Bullet.gd`, `Bullet.gd.uid` (from repo root)

### Schedule

- Iter 2 candidate = BUILD: enemies (Enemy.tscn + Enemy.gd + basic chaser
  AI + spawner stub). Advances criteria 2 + 6 simultaneously. Also creates
  a real bullet target so iter-1's collision register gets visual proof.
- ScheduleWakeup 240s (BUILD cadence per PROMPT §7)
- PLAYTEST gate remains iter 5
